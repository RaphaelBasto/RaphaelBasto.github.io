            <p style="width: 1000px; text-align: justify" ;="">
                Development of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000
                employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall and design engineer Sir
                Jonathan Ive to work on the highly confidential "Project Purple".<br>

                Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in
                the form of the iPad) towards a phone. Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with
                Cingular Wireless (which became AT&T Mobility) at the timeâ€”at an estimated development cost of US$150
                million over thirty months.<br>

                According to Steve Jobs, the "i" word in "iMac" (and therefore "iPod", "iPhone" and "iPad") stands for
                internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.<br>

                Apple rejected the "design by committee" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely
                unsuccessful collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited
                storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano.<br>

                Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house and even paid
                Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in exchange for four years of
                exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.<br>
                Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the
                Moscone Center in San Francisco. The two initial models, a 4 GB model priced at US$499 and an 8 GB model
                at US$599 (both requiring a two-year contract), went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at
                6:00 pm local time, while hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide. The passionate
                reaction to the launch of the iPhone resulted in sections of the media dubbing it the 'Jesus phone'.
                Following this successful release in the US, the first generation iPhone was made available in the UK,
                France, and Germany in November 2007, and Ireland and Austria in the spring of 2008.
